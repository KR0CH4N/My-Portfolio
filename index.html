                <p>Welcome to my Portfolio!</p>

           <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a Computer Engineering student driven by a deep passion for both hardware and software. 
            My journey blends electronics, embedded systems, and circuit design—exploring how devices function at 
            their core and transforming that knowledge into practical, real-world applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            I specialize in microcontroller programming using C, while also being proficienct in C++ and Java for software development. 
            My skill set also includes scripting languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, which I use for building web applications and managing databases.
            My development workflow is anchored in Visual Studio Code, where I focus on both frontend and backend engineering tasks. 
            Aside from that, I’m also well-versed in Microsoft Office tools—Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—making me highly adaptable across technical documentation, presentations, and workflow planning.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the hardware side, I integrate tools such as Proteus, Multisim, MPLAB, and KiCAD to support the design, simulation, 
            and implementation of electrical circuits and embedded systems. I also use AutoCAD for drafting schematics and technical layouts, especially when precision and documentation are critical. 
            These platforms allow me to visualize, test, and optimize my projects before deployment—ensuring both reliability and scalability.
            I also enjoy bridging the gap between digital logic and physical systems, crafting solutions that are not only technically 
            sound but also practical and efficient. Whether it's designing microcontroller-based applications or refining circuit layouts, I strive to create hardware that complements and enhances software functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond technical expertise, I’m motivated by modernizing workflows—streamlining academic, 
            engineering, and development processes to make them more efficient and impactful. 
            My goal is to become a well-rounded engineer capable of bridging hardware, software, and security to deliver 
            innovative solutions that matter.
